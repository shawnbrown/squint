Release Checklist
-----------------

1. Make sure correct version number is set in the following files:

   squint/__init__.py
   docs/conf.py

2. Make sure the description argument in setup.py matches the project
   description on GitHub.

3. Commit and push final changes to upstream repository:

     Prepare version info, CHANGELOG, and README for version X.X.X release.

4. Perform final checks to make sure there are no CI/tox test failures.

5. Make sure the packaging tools are up-to-date:

     pip install -U twine wheel setuptools

6. Remove all existing files in the dist/ folder.

7. Build new distributions:

     python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

8. Upload source and wheel distributions to PyPI:

     twine upload dist/*

9. Double check PyPI project page and test installation from PyPI.

10. Add version tag to upstream repository (also used by readthedocs.org).

11. Iterate version number in repository indicating that it is a development
    version (e.g., X.X.X.dev0) so that "latest" docs aren't confused with the
    just-published "stable" docs:

      squint/__init__.py
      docs/conf.py

    Commit these changes with a message like the one below:

      Iterate version number in development repository.

12. Make sure the documentation reflects the new versions:

    * https://squint.readthedocs.io/ (stable)
    * https://squint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (latest)

13. Publish update announcement to relevant mailing lists:

    python-announce-list@python.org
